What is reported in this publication?,comparison of the enzymatic activity of the two RNases followed by deliberations on the physiological consequences of their activation.
What is the conclusion regarding IRE1 and RNaseL proteins?,"In the context of a virus infection, the pathway leading from both these proteins have the potential to lead to cell death. Notwithstanding the fact that this might be an efficient way of virus clearance, it also portends pathological outcomes for the infected organism. Future research would probably lead to design of drugs targeting these proteins based on the structural homology of their effector domains, regulating the pathological denouement of their activation without compromising their anti-viral or potential anti-viral functions."

What are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution. ,The absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species (bat
What did the Nature Medicine paper report?,the construction of a chimeric CoV with a bat CoV S gene (SHC014) in the backbone of a SARS CoV that has adapted to infect mice (MA15) and is capable of infecting human cells
Why does the claim lack any scientific  basis?," because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new SARS-CoV-2 (>5,000 nucleotides)."
How was the mouse-adapted SARS virus (MA15) generated?,by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice.
How did  the SARS-CoV gain elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice ?,due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. 
Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?,due to the mouse adaptation.
"Why were civets proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans?","t was proposed that the S gene from bat-derived CoV, unlike that from human patients-or civetsderived viruses, was unable to use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells "
What was the finding  in 2013?,"several novel bat coronaviruses were isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats and the bat SARS-like or SL-CoV-WIV1 was able to use ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for entry "
 Why is it proposed that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts?,Combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ACE2 gene has been positively selected at the same contact sites as the human ACE2 gene for interacting with SARS CoV [
What was done to test if  an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts. T, the exact S gene from bat coronavirus SL-SHC014 was synthesized and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse adapted MA15 SARS-CoV backbone. 
What were the results of this test?,"The resultant SL-SHC014-MA15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ACE2 and replicate in primary human airway cells to similar titres as epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs, infection was attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15, which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice"
Why were experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted?,as gain of function (GOF) studies under the US government-mandated pause policy 
Why is there  no credible evidence to support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus?,"upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international groups [5, 14] , the SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly distinct from SL-SHC014-MA15, with >6,000 nucleotide differences across the whole genome."
"What did the rumour that the virus was made by humans in the lab, claim?",that SARS-CoV-2 has HIV sequence in it and was thus likely generated in the laboratory. I
What was reported in  a rebuttal paper led by an HIV-1 virologist Dr. Feng Gao?, they used careful bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple HIV insertions into the SARS-CoV-2 is not HIV-1 specific but random 
What happened to the report with initial claims?," Because of the many concerns raised by the international community, the authors who made the initial claim have already withdrawn this report."
What is the difference between evolution and synthetic constructs?,"Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13."
What is the conclusion of this report?, there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant CoV generated in nature between a bat CoV and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host. 
What is the conclusion of this report?,"More studies are needed to explore this possibility and resolve the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. We should emphasize that, although SARS-CoV-2 shows no evidence of laboratory origin, viruses with such great public health threats must be handled properly in the laboratory and also properly regulated by the scientific community and governments."

What can be a factor in using common vectors for the delivery of vaccines?,"commonly employed vectors, for example Salmonella and adenovirus, often have pre-existing immune responses in the host and this has the potential to modify the subsequent immune response to a vectored antigen. "
Is a pre-existing immune response to commonly used delivery vector an advantage or a disadvantage?,"for bacterial vectors there can in fact, in some cases, be an enhancement in immunogenicity, typically humoral, while for viral vectors pre-existing immunity is a hindrance for subsequent induction of cell-mediated responses."
What bacterial delivery vectors have been tested in animal hosts?," attenuated bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), specifically Lactococcus lactis, Mycobacterium, Listeria, Shigella and Salmonella, have been tested for the targeted delivery of heterologous antigens of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin into a variety of animal hosts"
Which bacteial delivery vectors have gained favor for vaccines?,Bacteria such as E. coli and lactic acid bacteria 
Why are E Coli and lactic acid are safe choices as delivery vectors for vaccines?,E. coli is a commensal and lactic acid bacteria are present in most fermented food items and are therefore naturally present in the host. They are also a much safer option than traditional attenuated vaccines in children and immunecompromised people.
What is Listeria?, Listeria species are Gram-positive intracellular food-borne pathogens
What is the advantage of Listeria as a  delivery vector for vaccines?,"The advantages of Listeria are that it can invade a variety of cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs). After invading the host cell, Listeria resides inside the phagosome; however, it can escape the phagosome with the help of listeriolysin O (LLO; Hly) and reside in the cytoplasm of the cells, thereby efficiently presenting antigen to both CD8 and CD4 T cells "
What are examples of  viral vectors for delivering vaccines?,"recombinant vaccines are based on both DNA viruses (such as fowlpox virus-based vaccines which target avian influenza virus and fowlpox virus, or vaccinia virusbased vectors against the rabies virus in wildlife) and RNA viruses [such as Newcastle disease virus-based vaccines to be used in poultry or yellow fever virus (YFV)-based vaccines to be used in horses against West Nile virus] "
Which viral vaccine delivery vector was first licensed?,"YFV (YF-17D strain) was the first to be licensed for use in humans, where the cDNAs encoding the envelope proteins of YFV were replaced with the corresponding genes of an attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus strain, SA14-14-2"

What is the advantage of adenovirus as vaccine delivery vector?,"adenovirus (Ad) vector is another of the most widely evaluated vectors to date to express heterologous antigens, due to ease of production, safety profile, genetic stability, the ease of DNA genome manipulation, and the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both T and B cell responses "
What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?,"a vaccine should be inexpensive, so that it can be administered to a large population at minimal cost"
What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?,"Safety is a major concern, as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable "
What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?,"long-lasting cellular and (where appropriate) humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines, preferably with a single dose"
What happens when a recipient of a vaccine has immune response to the delivery vector?,"considering a vector such as Salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the Salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response)"
What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,"for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen. Again, this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen."
What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,"theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared."
What is an example  of the effect of immunity to the  delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,"mice that had been primed with Salmonella alone, and then boosted with Salmonella expressing tetC, induced much lower anti-tetC responses than mice that had not been primed. This argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigen-specific humoral responses."
What is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors in the efficacy of vaccination?,"pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as Ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high [40-45 % and 70 % (or more) of the US population, respectively] "

"How does cell-mediated immunity to viral delivery vector, reduce the immune response to vaccine?"," this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. This is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes"
"How can vectors for which host has immunity, be used differently to increase the efficacy of vaccination?"," it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes. It may be that a vector such as Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus, with the ability to easily develop reassortants, will be useful in this context.

In addition, immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of Salmonella by macrophages and DC. This may be beneficial, as the live bacterial vector used for delivery purposes harbours mutations in genes encoding proteins responsible for their survival in the animal host. This not only encumbers their ability to cause disease, making them safe live vectors, but also limits the number of replications. The presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake, leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response."

What is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence?,"A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats’ virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics"
What is the conclusion of  this report?," heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-transmitting viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats."
Why  have bats received attention in recent years?,"for their role as reservoir hosts for emerging viral zoonoses, including rabies and related lyssaviruses, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS coronavirus "
What difference bats demonstrate compared to most non-Chiropteran mammals?,"no obvious disease symptoms upon infection with pathogens that are highly virulent in non-volant mammals (Schountz et al., 2017) but may, instead, support viruses as longterm persistent infections, rather than transient, immunizing pathologies"
What suite of species-specific mechanisms do bats have to limit viral load?,"host receptor sequence incompatibilities for some bat-virus combinations (Ng et al., 2015; Takadate et al., 2020) and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine"
How are mammalian cells typically rendered antiviral?," the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of type I interferon proteins (IFN-a and IFN-b), which promote expression and translation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells "
"In non-flying mammals, what what would be elicited by IFN expression upon viral infection?",widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection
What do the bats do instead?,bats support unique adaptations to combat inflammation
Why may the bats have this unique adaptation?,to mitigate metabolic damage induced during flight
Why  was the field of virus dynamics developed?,"to describe the mechanistic underpinnings of long-term patterns of steady-state viral load exhibited by patients in chronic phase infections with HIV, who appeared to produce and clear virus at equivalent rates "
How are bats connected to fatal viral diseases?,"bats are natural reservoirs for viruses that have some of the highest fatality rates of any viruses that people acquire from wild animals -including rabies, Ebola and the SARS coronavirus."
What is  an example of anti-viral defense in bats?,some bats have an antiviral immune response called the interferon pathway perpetually switched on
What would be caused by  this hyper-vigilance in most other mammals?, harmful inflammation
How are bats different?,"Bats, however, have adapted anti-inflammatory traits that protect them from such harm, include the loss of certain genes that normally promote inflammation."
What bat species cells were compared?,"-the black flying fox -in which the interferon pathway is always on, and another -the Egyptian fruit bat -in which this pathway is only activated during an infection."
What was the conclusion of the study ?," In both bat species, the strongest antiviral responses were countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell. This suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses, and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses, other creatures like humans are not."
What would be the benefit of learning more about bat's defenses and how they  drive virus evolution?,"help scientists develop better ways to predict, prevent or limit the spread of viruses from bats to humans. "

How were  the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells across tissue monolayers tracked via inverted fluorescence microscopy?,Because plaque assays restrict viral transmission neighbor-to-neighbor in two-dimensional cellular space 
How were  the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells tracked?," For each infection trial, we monitored and re-imaged plates for up to 200 hr of observations or until total monolayer destruction, processed resulting images, and generated a time series of the proportion of infectious-cell occupied plate space across the duration of each trial (see Materials and methods). We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combinatio"
How was the modeling carried out?,an innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics.
What was the finding in this study?,"that bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell virus transmission rates "
What supports the results?,"by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture."
What was additionally demonstrated?,"the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection."
What do  the studies suggest?,that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats.
What was the methodology for this study?,"we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model's equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions. We considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range for "", the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition. "
What was demonstrated in deriving the equation for R 0?," invasion threshold is elevated at high values of constitutive antiviral acquisition,"
What is a conclusion of the modeling?,"Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc."
What is a conclusion of the study?,"Regardless of mechanism (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid infection and concomitant cell death. "
What do  fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggest?,"that the constitutive IFN-a expression characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense."
What do the findings indicate?,enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence. 
What is presented in this study?,"general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes. "
What is a conclusion of  this study?, Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats.

Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage."
Which patients were classified as severe in Chinese guidelines?,"Patients who were with at least one of the following symptom should be diagnosed to be severe case, 1) distress of respiratory with respiratory rate > = 30/min; 2) Oxygen saturation  = 93% in the rest state, and 3) arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO₂) of less than 300 mm Hg. In the blood detection cohort (Figure 1 (A)), patients who had at less one serum sample measurement with the PCR method were included. "
What is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood sample and disease severity?," In the 57, 6 cases were detected to be blood positive, all of them (100%) were severe in symptom requiring special care attention, and the blood of the rest 51 cases was without detectable virus in the blood, only 12 of them (23.5%) were severe cases."

What could be the implication of 2019-nCOV virus in anal swabs?,digestive tract might be one extrapulmonary site for virus replication
What  could account for the high transmission rate of the 2019-nCOV virus?,"Intensive structural analysis of the S protein of 2019-nCoV with the SARS-Coronavirus suggested that several critical residues in the viral spike protein might confer favourable interaction with human ACE2 [7] . Of note, ACE2 is also abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the small intestine besides the respiratory tract and is ubiquitously present in endothelial cells [8] , which might provide possible routes of transmission, and might account for the high transmission capacity of the new virus. "
What could account for the dissemination of the 2019-nCOV virus across the whole body?,"We propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body. Then the virus succeeds in establishing reinfection in the digestive tract by using the highly expressed ACE2 receptor, which exacerbated the disease vice versa"

What does it mean for a pandemic to have a WHO alert level of 6?,spread in more than two continents
What was the estimated economic impact in the U.S. from the 2009 SARS pandemic?,estimated at $30-$100 billion
How is 2019-nCOV transmitted?,"2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia,"
What are ways in  which 2019-nCOV is transmitted?,"We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route."
"Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?",the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative.
"Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?"," patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. It is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. These patients would likely be considered as 2019-nCoV negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people."
What other tests should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology?,serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology.
What tests should  be done before a 2019-nCOV infected patient is discharged?,"we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral swabs negative, who may still shed the virus by oral-fecal route. Above all, we strongly suggest using viral IgM and IgG serological test to confirm an infection, considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection"
What symptoms were reported?,"Of the remaining 29, 20 reported fever, 14 reported cough and eight reported weakness. Additional symptoms reported included headaches (6 cases), sore throat (2), rhinorrhoea (2), shortness of breath (2), myalgia (1), diarrhoea (1) and nausea (1)"
What did the collected data include?,"demographics, history of recent travel to affected areas, close contact with a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, underlying conditions, signs and symptoms of disease at onset, type of specimens from which the virus was detected, and clinical outcome. "
When was COVID  surveillance implemented in European region?,27 January 2020
"As of 21 February, how many cases were reported?",47

What did the ECDC and WHO regional office ask the countries?, to complete a WHO standard COVID-19 case report form for all confirmed and probable cases according to WHO criteria
What was the overall aim of the surveillance?, to support the global strategy of containment of COVID-19 with rapid identification and follow-up of cases linked to affected countries in order to minimise onward transmission.
What were the surveillance objectives?,to: describe the key epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected in Europe; inform country preparedness; and improve further case detection and management. 
What is the adopted WHO case definition?,"a confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ECDC recommended two separate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests), irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive or positive using a pan-coronavirus assay"
When was the first reported death in France?,15 February
What is the presumed incubation period?, up to 14 days [
What were the places of infection?," 35 cases (missing for three cases), of whom 14 were infected in China (Hubei province: 10 cases; Shandong province: one case; province not reported for three cases). The remaining 21 cases were infected in Europe. "
What places were linked to these?,"14 were linked to a cluster in Bavaria, Germany, and seven to a cluster in Haute-Savoie, France "
How many cases were hospitalised?,All but two cases were hospitalised (35 of 37 where information on hospitalisation was reported)
Why were they hospitalised?, it is likely that most were hospitalised to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease. 
What was time from onset to hospitalisation?,ranged between 0 and 10 days with a mean of 3.7 days 
What was the duration of hospitalisation?,"The mean number of days to hospitalisation was 2.5 days for cases imported from China, but 4.6 days for those infected in Europe."
Why was this?,"This was mostly a result of delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany. In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six took only a mean of 2 days to be hospitalised."
"How many cases reported symptoms at this point?
", 31 cases
How many cases were asymptomatic?,Two cases 
What were the asymptomatic cases tested as?,as part of screening following repatriation and during contact tracing respectively.

In how many cases the symptoms at diagnosis were consistent with the case definition for acute respiratory infection?,In 16 of 29 symptomatic cases
How many cases had data on preexisting conditions?,seven cases
How many cases had no pre-existing conditions?,five
What other data on pre-existing conditions were reported?,one was reported to be obese and one had pre-existing cardiac disease. No data on clinical signs e.g. dyspnea etc. were reported for any of the 38 cases.
How many reported viral pneumonia?,two reported in Italy and two reported in France
What was the clinical evolution of the hospitalised cases?,"All hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four,"
What happened to three cases who were aged 65 years or over?,were admitted to intensive care and required respiratory support and one French case died.
What happened to the case who died?,was hospitalised for 21 days and required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 19 days
What was the duration of hospitalisation reported for 16 cases ?,a median of 13 days (range: 8-23 days)
How were the assays confirmed?,according to specific assays targeting at least two separate genes (envelope (E) gene as a screening test and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or nucleoprotein (N) gene for confirmation) 
What were the specimen types for 21 cases?,"15 had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, nine had positive throat swabs, three cases had positive sputum, two had a positive nasal swab, one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and one a positive endotracheal aspirate."
"As of 5 March 2020, what  are the cases in the WHO European region?","there are 4,250 cases including 113 deaths reported among 38 countries"
What were the two contexts for transmission?,sporadic cases among travellers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases).
What  does the analysis show on the difference between locally acquired cases vs imported cases?,that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases.
What is required for locally acquired cases?,"significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission's European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection.
"
What was common to all imported cases?,had a history of travel to China
What testing and detection are needed?,"Testing of suspected cases based on geographical risk of importation needs to be complemented with additional approaches to ensure early detection of local circulation of COVID-19, including through testing of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals irrespectively of travel history as recommended in the WHO case definition updated on 27 February 2020 "
What did the finding prompt ECDC to do?,include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.
Why is understanding the infection-severity  critical ?,to help plan for the impact on the healthcare system and the wider population.
Why are serological tests vital?,to understand the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic.
How can hospital based surveillance help?,help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death
How can present systems of surveillance be used?,"Established hospital surveillance systems that are in place for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded for this purpose. In addition, a number of countries in Europe are adapting and, in some cases, already using existing sentinel primary care based surveillance systems for influenza to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2"
How will  this approach used?,"will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity of disease transmission, trends and its geographical spread."
Why is additional research needed?," to complement surveillance data to build knowledge on the infectious period, modes of transmission, basic and effective reproduction numbers, and effectiveness of prevention and case management options also in settings outside of China."
What serious question was raised?,as to whether or not our seasonal or pandemic flu might have another reservoir host.
What is a recent discovery?,Bat is believed to harbor many more viruses than we ever thought as a reservoir host or even a susceptible host 
Which bat virus have been found to be linked with diseases?,"potential human infecting HKU-1, 4, 5 and 9 [17, 18] . Recent MERS-CoV infection is another example for severe disease caused by used-to-be-less pathogenic coronaviruses. Shi and colleagues [19] by using NGS have discovered many unknown animal viruses from bat, especially some important paramyxoviruses and reoviruses. Filovirus has also been identified in bat with potential severe outcomes. Lyssaviruses (with many genotypes, including rabies virus) in the Rhabdoviridae family have been linked with severe fatal human cases, even in the developed countries, including Australia, with the bites of bats in the city [20, 21] ."
What assay played an important role?,reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza epidemic?,50 million deaths worldwide
How many people were infected during the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic?,"An estimated one third of the world’s population (or
z500 million persons) were infected and had clinical-
ly apparent illnesses"
What was the case fatality rate in the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic?,"Case-
fatality rates were >2.5%, compared to 0.1% in other
inﬂuenza pandemics"
What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza epidemic?,"Total deaths were estimated at
z50 million (577) and were arguably as high as 100 mil-
lion "
Are the modern day Influenza viruses related to the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus?," All inﬂuenza A pandemics since that time, and
indeed almost all cases of inﬂuenza A worldwide (except-
ing human infections from avian Viruses such as H5N1 and
H7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918
Virus, including “drifted” H1N1 Viruses and reassorted
H2N2 and H3N2 Viruses."
Why is the Spanish Influenza virus the Mother of the modern influenza viruses?,"The latter are composed of key
genes from the 1918 Virus, updated by subsequently-incor—
porated avian inﬂuenza genes that code for novel surface

 

*Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rockville, Maryland, USA;
and TNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA

proteins, making the 1918 Virus indeed the “mother” of all
pandemics."
When was it  determined that the 1918  pandemic was caused by the H1N1 Influenza virus?,"That question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s,
when closely related inﬂuenza Viruses (now known to be
H1N1 Viruses) were isolated, ﬁrst from pigs and shortly
thereafter from humans. Seroepidemiologic studies soon
linked both of these viruses to the 1918 pandemic"
Did the Spanish Influenza or Swine flu or the H1N1 virus disappear in humans for some time?," descendants of the 1918
Virus still persists enzootically in pigs. They probably also
circulated continuously in humans, undergoing gradual
antigenic drift and causing annual epidemics, until the
1950s. With the appearance of a new H2N2 pandemic
strain in 1957 (“Asian ﬂu”), the direct H1N1 Viral descen-
dants 0f the 1918 pandemic strain disappeared from human
circulation entirely, although the related lineage persisted
enzootically in pigs."
When did the Swine Flu (Spanish Influenza) virus reappear in humans?," But in 1977, human H1N1 Viruses
suddenly “reemerged” from a laboratory freezer (9). They
continue to circulate endemically and epidemically."
What descendant  lineages of the swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus were identified in 2006?," 2 major descendant lineages of the 1918
H1N1 Virus, as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages,
persist naturally: a human epidemic/endemic H1N1 line-
age, a porcine enzootic H1N1 lineage (so-called classic
swine ﬂu), and the reassorted human H3N2 Virus lineage,
which like the human H1N1 Virus, has led to a porcine
H3N2 lineage."
Are the modern descendant influenza viruses as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu (Spanish Influenza) H1N1 virus?,"None of these Viral descendants, however,
approaches the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent Virus."
How dangerous are the modern H1N1 (swine flu) and the H3N2 (Influenza A) viruses compared  to the 1918 H1N1 (swine flu Spanish Influenza)  viruses?,"the human H1N1 and H3N2 lin-
eages have both been associated with substantially lower
rates ofillness and death than the virus of 1918. In fact, cur-
rent H1N1 death rates are even lower than those for H3N2
lineage strains (prevalent from 1968 until the present)."
"Are the descendant H1N1 strains of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus, still prevalent?","H1N1 Viruses descended from the 1918 strain, as well as 
H3N2 Viruses, have now been cocirculating worldwide for
29 years and show little evidence of imminent extinction."
Is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) known?,"ongoing studies to map Virulence
factors are yielding interesting results. The 1918 sequence
data, however, leave unanswered questions about the ori-
gin of the Virus (19) and about the epidemiology of the
pandemic."
What is the geographical origin of the H1N1 swine flu ?,"Historical and epidemiologic data are inade-
quate to identify the geographic origin of the Virus (21),
and recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 Viral genome
does not place the Virus in any geographic context"
Is the geographical origin of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu known?,"Confounding deﬁnite assignment of a geographic
point of origin, the 1918 pandemic spread more or less
simultaneously in 3 distinct waves during an z12-month
period in 191871919, in Europe, Asia, and North America
(the ﬁrst wave was best described in the United States in
March 1918)"
What is an unique feature of the 1918 swine flu?,"the simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) infection
of humans and swin"
What season or  time of the year do the new strains of influenza emerge?,"Historical records since the 16th century suggest that
new inﬂuenza pandemics may appear at any time of year,
not necessarily in the familiar annual winter patterns of
interpandemic years,"
"Once appeared, when do the influenza like diseases occur in subsequent years?","confronted by the selection pressures of population immu-
nity, these pandemic Viruses begin to drift genetically and
eventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur-
rences caused by the drifted Virus variants."
When did the first wave of the H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) occur?," a ﬁrst or spring wave
began in March 1918 and spread unevenly through the
United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next 6
months"
What was the death rate in the first wave of the 1918 swine flu pandemic?," Illness rates were high, but death rates
in most locales were not appreciably above normal."
When were the second and the third wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?," A sec-
ond or fall wave spread globally from September to
November 1918 and was highly fatal. In many nations, a
third wave occurred in early 1919 "
What was the primary difference between the first wave and the 2nd and 3rd wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?,"the much higher fre-
quency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last 2
waves."
Why the human influenza viruses do not disappear after herd immunity is developed?,"The occurrence, and to some extent the severity, of recur-
rent annual outbreaks, are driven by Viral antigenic drift,
with an antigenic variant Virus emerging to become domi-
nant"
What are the circumstances that promote the spread of influenza virus?," lower environ-
mental temperatures and human nasal temperatures (bene-
ﬁcial to thermolabile Viruses such as inﬂuenza), optimal
humidity, increased crowding indoors, and imperfect ven-
tilation due to closed windows and suboptimal airﬂow"
Do seasonal temperatures and humidity explain  the appearance of the three waves of the 1918 swine flu?,"such factors cannot explain the 3 pandemic
waves of 1918-1919, which occurred in the spring-sum-
mer, summer—fall, and winter (of the Northern
Hemisphere), respectively. The ﬁrst 2 waves occurred at a
time of year normally unfavorable to inﬂuenza Virus
spread. The second wave caused simultaneous outbreaks
in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from
September to November. "
Which virus samples  from the 1918 swine flu pandemic have been identified?,"pandemic Virus samples we have
yet identiﬁed are from second-wave patients"
Are viruses in the first and third waves of the 1918 swine flu pandemic same or derived from the virus from the second wave of the swine flu?,"nothing
can yet be said about whether the ﬁrst (spring) wave, or for
that matter, the third wave, represented circulation of the
same Virus or variants of it"
Was the 1918 swine flu virus novel to humans are was it derived from older viruses?,"Viral sequence data now suggest that the entire 1918
Virus was novel to humans in, or shortly before, 1918, and
that it thus was not a reassortant Virus produced from old
existing strains that acquired 1 or more new genes"
Do avian flu viruses change over long periods?,"Inﬂuenza Virus gene
sequences from a number ofﬁxed specimens ofwild birds
collected circa 1918 show little difference from avian
Viruses isolated today, indicating that avian Viruses likely
undergo little antigenic change in their natural hosts even
over long periods"
What  is the typical age profile of mortality in Influenza diseases?,"The curve of inﬂuenza deaths by age at death has histor-
ically, for at least 150 years, been U-shaped (Figure 2),
exhibiting mortality peaks in the very young and the very
old, with a comparatively low frequency of deaths at all
ages in between"
What was the age profile of mortality in the 1918 swine flu?,"age-speciﬁc death rates in the
1918 pandemic exhibited a distinct pattern that has not been
documented before or since: a “W—shaped” curve, similar to
the familiar U-shaped curve but with the addition of a third
(middle) distinct peak of deaths in young adults z20410
years of age"
Which age group was most susceptible to die during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,"Persons 65 years of age in 1918 had a dispro-
portionately high inﬂuenza incidence"
What was the death rate among children during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,"those 5 to 14
years of age accounted for a disproportionate number of
inﬂuenza cases, but had a much lower death rate from
inﬂuenza and pneumonia than other age groups. "
What theory provides partial explanation for the age-specific profile of the death rate in the 1918 swine flu pandemic?," the 1918 Virus had an intrinsically high Virulence, tem-
pered only in those patients who had been born before
1889, e.g., because of exposure to a then-circulating Virus
capable of providing partial immunoprotection against the
1918 Virus strain only in persons old enough (>35 years) to
have been infected during that prior era "
Is there a difference in the pathologic feature and course of disease between modern influenza pandemics and the 1918 swine flu pandemic?," the 1918
pandemic was different in degree, but not in kind, from
previous and subsequent pandemics. Despite the extraordi-
nary number of global deaths, most inﬂuenza cases in
1918 (>95% in most locales in industrialized nations) were
mild and essentially indistinguishable from inﬂuenza cases
today. "
Could the 1918 swine flu virus been controlled  by modern day drugs or vaccines?,"the 1918 and 1918-like Viruses would be
as sensitive as other typical Virus strains to the Food and
Drug Administrationiapproved antiinﬂuenza drugs riman-
tadine and oseltamivir."
Why was there such a high death rate in the 19118 swine flu pandemic?,"Clinically and pathologically, these
high death rates appear to be the result of several factors,
including a higher proportion of severe and complicated
infections of the respiratory tract, rather than involvement
of organ systems outside the normal range of the inﬂuenza
Virus. Also, the deaths were concentrated in an unusually
young age group"
Is the molecular basis of human adaptation of a virus understood?,"While data bearing
on inﬂuenza Virus human cell adaptation (e.g., receptor
binding) are beginning to be understood at the molecular
level, the basis for Viral adaptation to efﬁcient human-to-
human spread, the chief prerequisite for pandemic emer-
gence, is unknown for any inﬂuenza Virus."

What study  is reported in this report?,bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.
How does the genome of 2019-vCOV compare with   SARS like viruses and SARS-COV?,"Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses."
How different is it from SARS-related viruses?,the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. 
What novel features does the genome have?," its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands."
 What is important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.,"Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus"
What are Coronaviruses?,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronavirdiae, order Nidovirales."
What are four generas?,"Alphacoronavirus (αCoV), Betacoronavirus (βCoV), Deltacoronavirus (δCoV), and Gammacoronavirus (γCoV) "
What do  evolutionary analyses show?," that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most αCoVs and βCoVs, while avian species are the gene sources of most δCoVs and γCoVs."
What are the examples that have emerged as human pathogens?,"severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) which emerged in China in 2002-2003 to cause a large-scale epidemic with about 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) which has caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012"
Where did these viruses originate before crossing the barrier to infect humans?,these viruses have likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host [the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) for MERS-CoV] 
What COVs were known to infect humans before December 2019?,"6 CoVs were known to infect human, including 2 αCoV (HCoV-229E and HKU-NL63) and 4 βCoV (HCoV-OC43 [ "
What do HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 cause?,self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and elderly 
What is the contrast with SARS-COV and MERS=COV?," SARS-CoV (lineage B βCoV) and MERS-CoV (lineage C βCoV) may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as diarrhea, lymphopenia, deranged liver and renal function tests, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of ∼10% and ∼35%, respectively "
What was the authors' recent report on?,a familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection in a Shenzhen family with travel history to Wuhan 
What is analyzed in this study?,a 2019-nCoV complete genome from a patient in this familial cluster and compared it with the genomes of related βCoVs to provide insights into the potential source and control strategies.

What was the G+C content?,38%
How are 2019-nCOV and SARS-COV similar?,There are no remarkable differences between the orfs and nsps
Where is the major distinction?," in orf3b, Spike and orf8 but especially variable in Spike S1 and orf8 which were previously shown to be recombination hot spots."
What do the S1 and S2 subunits of spike glycoprotein contain?,"The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP)."
What are the chacateristics of the S2 subunit?,S2 subunit of 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV 
What would be the benefit of the identity of the S2 unit?, the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 would be an important preventive and treatment modality for testing in animal models before clinical trials 
How do the S1 subunits compare with that of SARS-likeCOV and human SARS-COV?,"Though the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV (Figure 3(A) ), the core domain of RBD (excluding the external subdomain) are highly conserved ("
Where are the amino acid differences?,"Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain,"
What is responsible for the interaction with  host receptor?," the external subdomain,"
what will the investigation of external subdomain reveal?,"its receptor usage, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis."

Approximately how many people died during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic?,"During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide."
What social and economic factors  contributed to the large fatality rate in the 1918 influenza pandemic?,"Malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time."
What problems were faced by medical staff during the 1918 epidemic?," in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. T"
What helpful drugs are available now to control the disease or to provide palliative care for influenza patients?," Today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like Tylenol or Advil."
How has the mortality rate due to influenza declined in USA over past decades?," in the United States of America, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons"
Is there an Influenza vaccine?,"We do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time."

What  factors would contribute now to the faster rates of influenza infections?,"Nowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other RNA viruses."
What factors would be responsible in future for the prevention of an Influenza pandemic?," influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. "
What was the detected fatality rate of H7N9 Avian flu?," the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from Taiwan, and one case from Hong Kong) (22, 23).
"
Why would real  case fatality rate for the H7N9 be lower than detected rate?,"most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower"
