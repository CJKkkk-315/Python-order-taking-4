scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism . 
this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer .

a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . 
lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending . 
a grating , emaciated flick . 
fairly run-of-the-mill .

wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
makes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight . 
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
a movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events . 
the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre .

the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .

two hours of junk . 
the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne

'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . ' 
alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating . 
a no-holds-barred cinematic treat .

a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh . 
at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .
